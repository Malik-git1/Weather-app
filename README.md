# Weather App

This is a simple weather forecast website made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
It shows the current weather of a city using the WeatherAPI.

## What this project does

- Shows temperature of the city
- Shows humidity and wind speed
- Shows weather condition (like sunny, cloudy, rainy)
- Shows date and time in AM/PM format
- Tells if it is day or night
- You can change temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit
- You can press Enter key to search the weather

## Drawbacks / Limitations

- You must enter a correct and valid city name  
  (wrong or unknown city names will not work)
- The API does not have all city names in the world  
  (some small towns or villages are missing)
- If we use latitude and longitude in the future, the API will not give the exact place  
  It only gives the closest city to those coordinates
- Free API has limited features and limited requests

## Future Plans

- Add search by latitude and longitude
- Add weather icons
- Improve the design
- Show forecast for next days

## Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS
